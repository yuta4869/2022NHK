============= IMPORTANT INFORMATION ========================

POST PROCESSORS

When testing the output from the post-processor for the first 
time, please ensure that you do a 'dry run' in mid-air to check
that the machine output behaves as expected.

If you do have problems with the machine output or any other
aspect of the program, please contact support@vectric.com or
